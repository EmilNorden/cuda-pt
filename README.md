# cuda-pt

__NOTE:__ This project was automatically exported from my old repository at Google Code (code.google.com/p/cuda-pt).
I am currently not working on it, so it's kind of a mess, but it *should* compile.

#### Description (taken from my old repository)

Real-time ray tracing using path tracing for global illumination achieved by utilizing the GPU. For images and video-recordings, check my flickr page: http://www.flickr.com/photos/emilnorden/sets/72157637053555824/
Note that this project is very young, and as such I am not really bothered about the state of the source code on here.
I will never check in failed builds, but you may need to make sure that all 3rd party libraries and/or source code are correctly linked/included in the build.

##### Roadmap
+ Maximize GPU utilization and kernel occupancy using Nvidias Visual Profiler.
+ Performance improvements.
+ Code refactoring.
+ Transparency and refraction.
+ On-screen text for FPS, camera values etc.
