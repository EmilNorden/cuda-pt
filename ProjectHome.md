Real-time ray tracing using path tracing for global illumination achieved by utilizing the GPU.

Note that this project is very young, and as such I am not really bothered about the state of the source code on here. I will never check in failed builds, but you may need to make sure that all 3rd party libraries and/or source code are correctly linked/included in the build.

## Roadmap ##
  * Maximize GPU utilization and kernel occupancy using Nvidias Visual Profiler.
  * Performance improvements.
  * Code refactoring.
  * Transparency and refraction.
  * On-screen text for FPS, camera values etc.
